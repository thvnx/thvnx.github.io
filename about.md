Since 2018, I am a software engineer at [Kalray](https://www.kalrayinc.com), a semiconductor company specialized in the application of MPPA manycore technology to high-performance processing.

Between 2015 and 2018, I used to be in a postdoc position at the [AriC](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/AriC/) project team, LIP, ENS de Lyon, France as an Inria engineer. My current research activities concern the conception of accurate, efficient, and reliable algorithms relying on the IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic in a compilation context, notably ARM targets. In this scope, I look after the adequacy of integer and floating-point instructions as well as for the FMA exploitation. This work takes place within the Nano 2017 program headed by STMicroelectronics.

In 2014, I completed a PhD at the [DALI](http://webdali.univ-perp.fr/) research team of the Perpignan University on a source-to-source transformation dealing with (numerical) accuracy and (execution) time criteria. I developed a code synthesis aiming to automatically trade off between accuracy and time constraints. I thereupon worked for [Numalis](http://www.numalis.com/), a startup developing a spellchecker for calculations!

I am interested in computer arithmetics, computer architecture, compilers, performance measurements, and programming in OCaml.
